This gem contains the unofficial WindowsLive strategy for OmniAuth.

Dirty hack to make it work with bing ads, I am only interested in getting a access- and refresh token to pull ads reports.

## Basic Usage

	use OmniAuth::Builder do
		provider "windowslive", ENV['WINDOWSLIVE_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['WINDOWSLIVE_SECRET'], :scope => 'wl.basic'
	end
